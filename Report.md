## Overview of the System

OvaView aims to simplify the monitoring and organizing of menstrual cycles for users. The period tracker provides a platform to eloquently track, organize, and predict your menstrual health all while keeping your privacy safe and secure. Our system aims to provide a stress-free and elegant way to stay on top of your body's health while ensuring no one else but you gets to track this intimate data.

The period tracking ecosphere is an almost $4 billion market, yet a fully privacy-minded option is yet to exist [^1]. **(sample system comparison goes here, but have some research comprehensive ready)**
