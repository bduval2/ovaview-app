# Main Contributions

### Workflow

* Helped organize gitlab by creating issues for myself and other members, clearing out old issues, etc.
* Set up the meeting minutes for all of the meetings, and was also the one who took notes for each of the meetings.

### Initial Research

* Research for possible system ideas. Period tracker was one of the ideas I proposed. 
* Once we settled on the idea of doing a period tracker, I researched what features otehr period trackers had and [made a list.](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/bduval2/comp555-project-group-9/-/wikis/Target-System-Selection/3.Third-Draft/Alex-Research)

### Development of the propotype

* Designed the entire front-end and created a [mock-up Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/3kOyxvEC9jON2Q9Y8yqG5K/COMP-555-Project?node-id=17%3A5724&t=PZdwa1OfgsbCQF4L-1)
*Designed the illustrations used on the front end by using Free-to-use assets from [StorySet](https://storyset.com) and combining multiple assets together to create more enticing visuals.
* Researched which front-end technology to use. Read up on Bootstrap documentation and guides, as well as numerous javascript tutorials.
* Built the front end from scratch.
* Collaborated with @bduval2 to merge the front-end and back-end together by calling on Zoom and using the Live Collaboration extension on Visual Studio Code.
* Collaborated with @spark186 to write the copy on the front-end (Home Page and Privacy Policy Page)
* Contributed to all the logical discussions regarding how data should be handled in the backend, how users should be made aware of privacy requirements, etc.

### Documentation

* Set up the slides for our presentation and made some of the illustrations used (though each member made their own slides overall).
* Helped @bduval2 with the UML sequence diagrams
