                            <p>The OvaView app aims to keep as little identifying data as possible on the central server. We value user freedom and self-governance on their data, and hold a strong dogma regarding <strong>choice</strong>; users are defaulted to the barebones of data submission and encourage customization to fit each individual&#39;s unique preferences and needs.</p>

                        <div>
                            <h2 id="2-anonymous-accounts">2. Anonymous Accounts</h2>
                            <p>A modern day problem is the need for every service, regardless of its function, to require consumers to hand over their PII (<strong>Personal Identifiable Information</strong>). If you think about it, why does your budgeting app that only keeps track of what you spent your money on require you to enter so many various pieces of information to use it? Name, email, date of birth, gender, location, etc. are obviously not needed to make sure your app can remind you that you have been spending far too much money on snacks this past month, so what is the deal?</p>
                            <p>Companies profit massively from gathering data and selling it off en masse to various advertising, research, and analytical companies. Many services put up a fa√ßade to users that they require users to give them their information to &quot;help enhance their experience&quot;, forgetting to disclose to users that the funds they use to &quot;better&quot; their service came from selling said data.</p>
                            <p>Because of this, there is a barrier to entry for potential consumers. They find a simple service that they wish to use for convenience or entertainment, but need to trade their PII to use said service.</p>
                            <h4 id="our-fully-anonymous-position">Our Fully Anonymous Position</h4>
                            <p>We recognize that the function of our service is fairly simple. The user inputs what they want to keep track of, and optionally asks for a prediction based on this data. <strong>In no step of our product process is there a need for the data given to us to be linked to a name, face, or alias.</strong></p>
                            <p>Because of this, we developed an account system that requires no user information to create and use. Each profile is identified by a unique 16-digit token that is generated by our system on registration, with no requirements. Users do not need to give us any information to create a token and get started using our product.</p>
                            <p>We limit user intervention on account identification for various security reasons. Although having your account number generated for you instead of allowing you to choose it yourself may feel limiting and unfamiliar, this method offers several benefits:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>It keeps the accounts more anonymous. If a user selects their own username, it could potentially help identify them. For example, a user might choose the same username that is used on other services or the language and style of the username may reveal their country of origin or cultural background.</li>
                            <li>It prevents a user from selecting a weak password. Many people use weak passwords and/or use the same password across multiple services. With a lengthy and random account number, we can ensure that it is long enough to be secure and greatly reduce the risk of it being used for another service, since the user would have to copy the hard-to-remember number they received from us and use it elsewhere.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Your account number serves as both the username and password, meaning it is both the account&#39;s unique token (username) and the secret that authenticates the account towards our service (password). Therefore, you should keep it as safe and secret as a password.</p>
                            <h4 id="what-if-someone-brute-forces-my-account-">What if Someone Brute-forces My Account?</h4>
                            <p>When an account is created, it is assigned a 16-digit decimal number within the range of &quot;1000 0000 0000 0000&quot; to &quot;9999 9999 9999 9999&quot;. This range provides a total of 9 &times; 10 <sup>15</sup> possible account numbers, making it highly unlikely for someone to guess a valid account number. Assuming that there are 100,000 active accounts, an average of 45 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> attempts would be required to find a working account, which is practically impossible.</p>

                            <p>OvaView processes data with the sole intent of providing users the ability to keep a record book of their menstrual cycle and personal activities, feelings, and/or symptoms related to their menstrual cycles.</p>
                            <p>Optionally, upon explicit user consent, we process <strong>user inputted</strong> data to provide additional features such as cross-platform syncing and/or personal menstrual cycle prediction.</p>
                            <p>Our menstrual cycle prediction algorithm is lightweight and optimized; on mobile apps we process our consumers&#39; information locally, however web users have their data submitted to our servers to be analyzed. No step in our algorithm requires us to disclose user data to third parties, and said data is only processed by our servers once to produce our prediction: after calculations, we do not process any more data until the next cycle is needed to be predicted.</p>

                            <p>The following inventory data is stored in our central server <strong>by default</strong>:</p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            <p>No other data is stored if a user creates an account and does not touch any settings. <strong>We never store data that is not unnecessary to the app function without explicit, clear, and consistent user consent.</strong> This choice is tied to our belief that everyone has a right to privacy and all consumers deserver full autonomy over their data.</p>
                            <p>For cross-device purposes, users can opt-in to storing information to be synced up in other devices:</p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>None of the information will be passed on to third parties. All data remains in the server until deleted by the user. Once user requests and confirms erasure, there is no way to retrieve or recover deleted information.</p>
