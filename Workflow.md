# Workflow Statement

All work activity has been published on the GitLab repository, which uses TLS Strict, HTTPS, and Universal SSL to encrypt data in transit, as well as encrypting all data at rest using Google Cloud Platform supporting AES-256 [^1].

## Work Strategy

To optimize our workflow, we followed the following routine to develop our app:

1. Identify the tasks that need to be done and create corresponding [issues on GitLab](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/bduval2/comp555-project-group-9/-/issues)
2. Determine assignees who are responsible for the completion of tasks
3. Organize the tasks into a sequence, creating prerequisite tasks and co-dependent tasks
4. Test the workflow
5. Review and repeat

Our workflow found much success using the GitLab platform, that allowed us to reference links in task descriptions and comments securely. All documentation was produced in collaboration in the [wiki section](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/bduval2/comp555-project-group-9/-/wikis/pages) of our repository. All code and its iterations throughout development were published only on [our repository](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/bduval2/comp555-project-group-9/-/tree/main). All code commits were labelled with the corresponding issue the push relates to, as well as a quick description of the changes.

Much coding development happened via the Live Collaboration extension on Visual Studio Code, which ensures proper SSH protocol to secure our work sessions [^2]. 

Frequent meetings were held on Zoom, secured with their E2EE option turned on for all our meetings [^3]. The meetings were documented for all of the participants, discussions, conflicts, resolutions, and goals made during them. All meeting documentations are published in the [wiki section](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/bduval2/comp555-project-group-9/-/wikis/pages) of our repository.

Each individual work contribution statements can be found in the [contributions subdirectory in our repository](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/bduval2/comp555-project-group-9/-/tree/main/contributions).
